# Personal-Website-Pt-1-Career-Simulation
This project is to build a website about myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
<p>There should be three pages (Home, About, and Portfolio) that all link to each other using a navigation bar at the top of the page.
The Home page should include a picture of myself, my name, and somethhing that defines who I am as a person. 
The About page should include hobbies, interests, and goals that I have. 
The Portfolio page should include some projects that I am particulary proud of in my current career and a description of each. </p>
